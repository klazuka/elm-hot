Work-in-progress: DO NOT USE

Very early support for Elm 0.19 hot module reloading. This is based on the work of Flux Xu's [elm-hot-loader](https://github.com/fluxxu/elm-hot-loader), which is no longer being maintained.

My goals are:
- make it work with Elm 0.19
- make the Webpack dependency optional
- add integration tests
